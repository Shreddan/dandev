                <p class="mb-3">I'm talking about <strong>Autism</strong> A word that when dropped into conversation, can make
                    those you are talking to go quiet for a moment as if considering their words.</p>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Autism</strong> is a very divisive topic, which makes sense seeing as Autism itself is a
                    spectrum. On the one hand there is alot more support and awareness in terms of autism, especially when
                    compared to even only 10 or 15 years ago.</p>
                <p>However there still those that aren't sure what to think about it, and this is what (I think) causes the
                    moment of silence during the conversation. I fully understand that for those that have no experience with
                    Autism that it might be a difficult topic to talk about, especially in this day and age, when it feels like
                    it can be so easy to offend people.</p>
