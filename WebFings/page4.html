<h3><u>Project : OLCMud / MUD Client</u></h3>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ive managed to create a MUD client in the console with ANSI Colour support! wooohooo, in fairness though the ansi part was way easier than I expected it just meant changing the console mode to enable processed output and virtual terminal stuff :D<br> Next job is to fix a bug where sending to the server requires two sends to get the commands to work, but only after the OnConnect sequence....</p>

<h3><u>Project : OLCMud / MUD Client</u></h3>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">You would think creating a MUD client sounds easy right?<br>WRONG<br> What I did not realise when I began is that its not as easy as just creating a websocket, and connecting and outputting the received information to the screen.<br>There are certain telnet Protocols that have to be followed in order to get the data to display in a way that is readable.<br>During this time I have had to try to learn about <b>Telnet</b>, <b>Negotiations</b> and <b>Sub-Negotiations</b> and what certain bytes mean. <b>(IAC, WILL, WONT, DO, DONT)</b><br> This will most certainly be a fun project indeed....  </p>

<h3><u>Project : Text-Adventure/Single User Dungeon</u></h3>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">I decided to give up on Regex, as a friend advised me, I didnt actually need it at all, and I could just check the Command string with an IF, and then it worked!, which was fantastic, I do however still need to figure out the right Algorithm in order to create a map that makes sense, I will be adding to this entry within the next couple of days...</p>

<h3><u>Project : Text-Adventure/Single User Dungeon</u></h3>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">This week, I decided to have a go at a Text Adventure/Single User Dungeon type of game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now most programmers or game designers will usually start off with some form of plan, however....</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I am not most programmers, I'm more of an On-The-Fly kind of guy, I like to let the plans work themselves out as I go. So I started out by creating my structs and creating my variables and such, and then i had a bit of a think about how I want this to work. Obviously a text-based game is going to require some form of Commands, so I did some googling and came across something called <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex" class="a1" style="font-size:12px;"><b>Regular Expressions</b></a>, which allows you to create an expression and then match an input string to that expression, and I am hoping that by learning how to do this, I will be able to work out some form of Commands system, I then went on to create a World, which is really just a place to hold the Areas, and then the Rooms are contained within the Areas.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After that, I created a function to give the rooms Descriptions and created a Look Command for the player aswell as the four directions. I made the Game loop, initialised everything and did a test run with just one room.<br>
However my Look command wouldnt work, I tried everything I rearranged the regexs(Regular Expressions), added them to a vector but got very stuck when only the last regex would match every time.
I decided it was time to take a break for a while and come back with fresh eyes the next day, which I did but I still couldnt figure it out. I tried different If statements, Else Ifs and everything.<br>
But alas to no avail.</p>
