    <p class="mb-3">My name is Daniel(Dan) Twitchett. I live in the Republic of Ireland, County Roscommon.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">I am 28 years old, I have a beautiful partner and 6 wonderful children, two of which are ASD (On the Autism
        Spectrum), so theres a little background to start us off :)</p>
    <p class="mb-3">As you may have read on the main page, I started learning to code in around September of 2018, at that time I had
        rediscovered an old game that I used to play when I was a child, this game was Creatures Exodus(back then it was
        just called Creatures 3 and Docking Station/Creatures Internet Edition), So I bought the game on GOG.com, and
        started playing again.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">However it was a bit fiddly to set up properly, as I had to apply some community made patches in order for it to
        still work since the original services for this game went down around 10 ish years ago(considering the game is
        almost 20 years old), if you want to learn about that please go to the
        <a href="/resources" class="font-bold underline">Resources</a> page to find out more!</p>
    <p class="mb-3">Whilst on my journey, looking for patches I came across a project known as openc2e on GitHub.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">The project had been abandoned almost 8 years before, with the only activity really being people updating it to
        work with the lastest releases of Boost, and from there I decided I wanted to learn how to code</p>
    <p class="mb-3">Shortly after that in the beginning of 2019, I found the OneLoneCoder Community, after finding Javidx9's youtube
        channel.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">I binge-watched most of the videos on the channel, and then found the discord server. I have been a member of
        this server ever since, and have made many friends.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">When I first joined the server, I hadnt been coding very long and essentially only knew not even the
        real basics of coding, I had tried coding in Java before and a little bit of GDScript, but even then I was not
        very far past the "Hello World" stage. :)</p>
    <p class="mb-3">With the help of the community and some trial and error by myself(mostly error :P), my confidence is
        steadily growing.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">If you have always wanted to code, but dont know where to start or how to go about it, I would highly recommend
        Javidx9's youtube channel
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA" class="font-bold underline">OneLoneCoder</a>
        and I would also suggest joining his discord server.</p>
    <p>The community is one of the nicest and most helpful that I have ever come across, and Javidx9 is also very active
        on the server too!</p>
